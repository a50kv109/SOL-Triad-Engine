"""Pre-SOL v0.1: Autonomous Diagnostic and Task Framing Module.

Pre-SOL operates strictly as an external pre-processing and diagnostic layer.
It preserves raw_query immutably, classifies statements on dual axes,
evaluates analysis and formalization readiness separately, enforces the
safety barrier invariant, and NEVER creates mock evidence or authorizes execution.
